0,Hepatitis A and B Infections.,"Hepatitis A virus causes acute viral hepatitis, presenting with jaundice, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms are self-limited and treated symptomatically. Routine vaccination of infants has greatly reduced the incidence in the United States. Vaccination is recommended for all infants and adults at increased risk. Hepatitis B virus can cause acute and chronic viral hepatitis. Acute hepatitis B is usually self-limited, but can develop into a chronic infection. Patients are at highest risk for developing chronic disease if they are infected at a younger age. Routine vaccination and universal screening of pregnant women has decreased the transmission of hepatitis B virus."
1,Hepatitis A: clinical manifestations and management.,"Due to improved living conditions and subsequent changes in hepatitis A epidemiology, the disease burden of hepatitis A is increasing in many regions. Recently, Korea has faced a large, community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A, which has prompted a vaccination program. The clinical spectrum of hepatitis A virus infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to fulminant hepatitis. Clinical manifestations depend on the age of the host: less than 30% of infected young children are symptomatic, while about 80% of infected adults manifest severe hepatitis with remarkably elevated serum aminotransferases. Fulminant hepatitis is rare, with a reported incidence from 0.015 to 0.5%. Atypical manifestations include relapsing hepatitis and prolonged cholestasis, and complicated cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Extrahepatic manifestations, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, pleural or pericardial effusion, acute reactive arthritis, acute pancreatitis, acalculous cholecystitis, mononeuritis, and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, have been rarely reported. Management of hepatitis A includes general supportive care, and critical decisions regarding liver transplantation await further studies on prognostic predictors. Fundamental management of hepatitis A is active vaccination. However, a vaccination program should be adapted to the regional situation, according to differing epidemiology and disease burden."
2,An epidemic of cockles-associated hepatitis A in Singapore.,"An epidemic of serologically confirmed hepatitis A occurred between May and September 1983 in Singapore. The vehicle of transmission was traced to raw and partially cooked cockles, Anadara granosa, which had been imported from places with no sanitary control on the production. Strict controls on imported cockles are warranted."
3,Acute hepatitis A in an elderly patient after care worker travel to high endemicity country.,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is considered one of the most important vaccine-preventable diseases in travelers. HAV spreads from person to person via the fecal-oral route and gives rise to an estimated 1.4 million cases worldwide each year. In developing countries with poor sanitary conditions people tend to be infected during childhood and have few symptoms, whereas in developed countries with good sanitary conditions fewer people develop immunity during childhood. This leads to susceptible populations of adults, who are also more prone to severe complications. Here we describe two confirmed cases of hepatitis A associated with a nursing home. The index case was a care worker who had recently traveled to a high-endemicity country, and the second case was a resident at the nursing home where the index case worked. Both cases had an identical genotype IIIA strain, consistent with a transmission event. Current policy does not include a requirement for hepatitis A vaccine in care workers who travel to high endemicity countries despite the fact that infected care workers can potentially spread the disease to elderly patients and other groups at risk of severe complications from HAV infection. We suggest that employers should consider hepatitis A vaccine upon employment; particularly in care workers who plan to visit areas where HAV is known to be endemic."
4,Diagnosis of hepatitis a virus infection: a molecular approach.,"Current serologic tests provide the foundation for diagnosis of hepatitis A and hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. Recent advances in methods to identify and characterize nucleic acid markers of viral infections have provided the foundation for the field of molecular epidemiology and increased our knowledge of the molecular biology and epidemiology of HAV. Although HAV is primarily shed in feces, there is a strong viremic phase during infection which has allowed easy access to virus isolates and the use of molecular markers to determine their genetic relatedness. Molecular epidemiologic studies have provided new information on the types and extent of HAV infection and transmission in the United States. In addition, these new diagnostic methods have provided tools for the rapid detection of food-borne HAV transmission and identification of the potential source of the food contamination."
5,Hepatitis A: epidemiology in resource-poor countries.,"Purpose of review: Transmission of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is primarily fecal-oral. Symptomatic hepatitis, severe disease, and death are more likely to occur when infection occurs at an older age. Improvements in socioeconomic and hygienic conditions have led to a change in its epidemiology worldwide. Recent findings: In the last two decades, improved hygiene in several resource-poor countries has led to reduced transmission of HAV, an increase in average age at infection, and, consequently, a paradoxical increase in morbidity and mortality because of hepatitis A. In Argentina, introduction of one dose (instead of the conventional two doses, to reduce costs) of inactivated HAV vaccine at 12-month age in a universal childhood immunization program during such 'epidemiologic transition' has markedly reduced the incidence of symptomatic hepatitis A, and of fulminant hepatitis and liver transplantation caused by HAV infection. The monetary value of medical and nonmedical benefits of this strategy outweighed the expenditure on vaccination. These excellent results were possibly contingent upon a high vaccination coverage. Summary: Resource-poor countries should closely monitor the epidemiology of HAV infection and periodically undertake cost-effectiveness analyses of HAV immunization strategies. This should allow timely identification of epidemiologic transition and introduction of preventive strategies before HAV infection becomes a public health problem."
6,[Viral hepatitis A - possible diagnostic and therapeutic problems].,"Viral hepatitis A (VHA) is the disease which has an ancient history. Reports of epidemic jaundice were described by Hippocrates in Greece during the 5th century B.C. Incidence of VHA in developed countries is dropping in last decades. What was once common disease is now very rare, usually emerging in local epidemies. With decreasing incidence of hepatitis A clinicians losing practical experiences with disease. Authors present possible diagnostic and therapeutic problems based on their experience with large epidemic of hepatitis A, which occurred in 2016-2017 in Brno area.Key words: hepatitis A (VHA) - hepatitis A virus (HAV)."
7,[Hepatitis A outbreak in a day care center and household transmission].,"Background: An outbreak of hepatitis A occurred in a day care center in Madrid between October 2002 and February 2003 and spread to the children's families. Patients and methods: We performed a descriptive study of this outbreak and of the control measures adopted. Results: The outbreak affected 23 people: eight children aged 1-3 years (attack rate= 8.7 %), two staff members (attack rate=10.5 %), and 13 household contacts. Of the 23 cases, 17 were confirmed by serology and eight patients were hospitalized. The control measures were: (i) increasing general hygiene measures in the home and school and, in particular, those concerning diaper changing by staff, and (ii) vaccination of all pupils aged more than one year (92 children), staff members (16 adults) and family contacts of affected individuals. After vaccination, the epidemic curve showed intrafamilial transmission exclusively. Cases among familial contacts affected adults in contact with asymptomatic children. Conclusions: Vaccination was effective in controlling the epidemic outbreak within the day care center. However, when outbreaks occur, vaccination should be prescribed to close contacts of all the children, whether symptomatic or not, especially parents and siblings. The recommendation that day care center workers undergo vaccination on taking up their posts should be put into practice, since vaccination is not systematically performed. General vaccination would be the most effective measure for preventing outbreaks in educational centers."
8,Clinical features of re-emerging hepatitis A: an analysis of patients hospitalized during an urban epidemic in Korea.,"From April 2008 to November 2008, many cases of hepatitis A were reported in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province in Korea. Furthermore, the rate of severe or fulminant hepatitis have significantly increased during the latest epidemic (13.4% vs. 5.2%, p=0.044). Therefore, widespread use of vaccine is warranted to reduce the burden of hepatitis A in Korea."
9,[Hepatitis A].,"Hepatitis A infection is known since the ancient Chinese, Greek and Roman civilizations but the first documented report was published in the eighteenth century. The hepatovirus belongs to the Picornaviridae family, and carries a single strand RNA. There are 7 genotypes. Antibodies of the IgM and IgA classes, during natural infections, appear early in the serum, together with the first clinical manifestations of the disease, but they may also appear at the end of the first week of infection. There is a spectrum of clinical presentation: asymptomatic infection, symptomatic without jaundice and symptomatic jaundiced. A rare fatal form of hepatitis has been described. Diagnosis of the hepatitis A infection is confirmed by the finding of IgM anti-HAV antibodies, routinely performed using an ELISA test. Treatment is supportive. Intramuscular anti-A gamma globulin is used for passive immune prophylaxis, and there is an efficient vaccine for active immune prophylaxis."
