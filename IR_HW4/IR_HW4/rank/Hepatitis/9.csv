0,Outbreak of food-borne type-A hepatitis in Greater Glasgow.,"In a fourteen-day period between December, 1974, and January, 1975, 12 out of 118 members of a Glasgow golf club, who had attended their annual dinner/dance at a popular hotel in Glasgow six weeks previously, developed acute icteric hepatitis. Epidemiological investigations suggest that the infection was due to contamination of the cream used in fruit salad and sherry trifle prepared by a pastry-cook at a time when he was incubating type-A hepatitis."
1,Hepatitis A in Italy: epidemiology and suggestions for control.,"Seroepidemiologic and surveillance data show that hepatitis A is declining in both Northern and Southern Italy, in the latter the decline has been more recent. Every year about two thousand cases of acute disease occur. Shellfish consumption and travel to endemic areas are at present the most important risk factors in Italy. Use of immunoglobulin is effective in controlling outbreaks and preventing hepatitis A among travellers. Active immunization for travellers to endemic areas will be recommended, when a vaccine will be available. Adequate cooking of shellfish is at present the only advisable measure to prevent the risk represented by their consumption. Acute morbidity and the occurrence of outbreaks suggest the need to keep our attention on hepatitis A infection in Italy."
2,[Experience on the management of a hepatitis A outbreak in a children daycare center].,"Background: Since hepatitis A virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, outbreaks in nurseries are favored by constant diaper changes and failures in hygienic measures. The purpose of this investigation was to describe an outbreak of hepatitis A between November 2012 and February 2013 at a nursery in Mexicali, Baja California, as well as the measures adopted for its control. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted on the outbreak and the control measures, calculating the rates of attack and establishing proportions using the Wilson's scale. Pupils, workers or family members with symptoms consistent with hepatitis A were considered to be suspected cases. First-occurrence hepatitis A records were reviewed on the Weekly Disease Surveillance Report at the involved medical units and on the nursery's infirmary records. Results: The global attack rate was 13.1 %, and in those captive in the nursery, 9.5 %. Jaundice, biliuria and abdominal pain were the most important clinical data. There were no deaths or hospitalizations. The outbreak lasted 86 days. Control measures were based on epidemiological surveillance reinforcement and preventive hygienic measures. Conclusions: The outbreak showed a spreading trend, it affected mainly children and showed the importance of health education and epidemiological surveillance maintenance, extensive to the familial setting."
3,Outbreak of hepatitis A spread by contaminated drinking glasses in a public house.,"Ten cases of hepatitis A were associated with a public house whose barman had chronic non-infectious diarrhoea and had served drinks while incubating hepatitis A himself. Eight cases had drunk in the public house in the two weeks before the barman became ill, had no other risk factors for hepatitis A infection, and were regarded as primary cases. Two other cases had visited the pub during the same period, but were classified as secondary cases because they became ill later and were contacts of primary cases. Sexual transmission was excluded. Fomite transmission by contamination of glasses was a more likely route of spread of the infection among the eight primary cases than food or contaminated surfaces in the toilet."
4,"Hepatitis A in children- clinical course, complications and laboratory profile.","Objective: To study the course and complications of hepatitis A in children. Methods: Seventy eight children diagnosed as acute viral hepatitis A by IgM antiHAV were prospectively studied for involvement of other systems and complications. Results: The mean age of children was 7.85 Â± 3.4 y. Jaundice was present in all the patients as this was the inclusion criteria. Fever was present in 82.1 %, hepatomegaly in 98.7 % and splenomegaly in 39.7 %. More than 5 fold rise in Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Alaninetransaminase (ALT), were seen in 62 cases (79.5 %) and 55 cases (70.5 %) respectively. Coagulopathy (Prothrombin time INR > 1.5) was observed in 12 cases (15.4 %) and abnormal APTT in 10 cases (12.8 %). Thrombocytopenia was observed in 5.1 % of children and 8.9 % had more than 2 hematological abnormalities. Ascites was noted in 35 cases (44.9 %), gallbladder wall thickening in 32 cases (41 %) and pleural effusion in 11 cases (14.1 %). Acute renal failure, acute glomerulonephritis and acute pancreatitis were present in 1 case (1.3 %) each. Raised CK-MB values more than 3 times the normal was noted in 5 cases (6.4 %). On follow up, most of the children recovered completely by 2 mo and prolonged cholestasis was observed in 2 of them. In the present study mortality was 1.3 % and it was attributable to fulminant hepatic failure. Conclusions: Eventhough hepatitis A infection is a self-limiting disease, extrahepatic manifestations and mortality are not uncommon. All cases should be followed up till complete recovery and only a strong index of suspicion will enable us to recognize the complications."
5,Hepatitis A Virus: Essential Knowledge and a Novel Identify-Isolate-Inform Tool for Frontline Healthcare Providers.,"Infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes a highly contagious illness that can lead to serious morbidity and occasional mortality. Although the overall incidence of HAV has been declining since the introduction of the HAV vaccine, there have been an increasing number of outbreaks within the United States and elsewhere between 2016 and 2017. These outbreaks have had far-reaching consequences, with a large number of patients requiring hospitalization and several deaths. Accordingly, HAV is proving to present a renewed public health challenge. Through use of the ""Identify-Isolate-Inform"" tool as adapted for HAV, emergency physicians can become more familiar with the identification and management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with exposure, infection, or risk of contracting disease. While it can be asymptomatic, HAV typically presents with a prodrome of fever, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain followed by jaundice. Healthcare providers should maintain strict standard precautions for all patients suspected of having HAV infection as well as contact precautions in special cases. Hand hygiene with soap and warm water should be emphasized, and affected patients should be counseled to avoid food preparation and close contact with vulnerable populations. Additionally, ED providers should offer post-exposure prophylaxis to exposed contacts and encourage vaccination as well as other preventive measures for at-risk individuals. ED personnel should inform local public health departments of any suspected case."
6,Community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A among an Indian population in Oklahoma.,"Between September 1983 and September 1984, 118 cases of hepatitis A were reported from Caddo County, Oklahoma. No common source was identified, and the epidemic curve suggested person-to-person transmission. In July 1984, enhanced control measures were implemented; these consisted of improvements in surveillance, standardization of case investigation, an expanded, although targeted, use of immune globulin, and a public awareness campaign. Control measures resulted in a decrease in the delay between onset of symptoms and case report (from 12 days to 4 days), an increase in the percentage of patients with confirmed cases interviewed (from 77% to 100%), an increase in the percentage of patients reporting contact with a previous case (from 39% to 72%), and an increase in the average number of household-like contacts per case (from seven to 27). Within two incubation periods of the implementation of enhanced controls, the outbreak ended. These data indicate that community-wide outbreaks of hepatitis A can be stopped with an intensive epidemiologic approach, coupled with the expanded and targeted use of immune globulin."
7,[The epidemiological differential diagnostic signs of viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis E].,"A retrospective epidemiologic analysis of cases diagnosed as hepatitis A (HA) has been made in territories characterized by high intensity (4 towns in Central Asia) and low intensity (Novomoskovsk, Tula Province) of the epidemic process development. Morbidity structures for different age and social groups of the population, as well as the morbidity time course, both annual and over many years, were analyzed over 1973-1986. Specific features in the development of the epidemic process in HA and hepatitis E (HE), formerly called hepatitis non-A, non-B with the fecal/oral mechanism of the infection transmission, were studied. Twelve epidemiological differential diagnostic signs of these two infections were formulated, classified, and validated. Contribution of centralized water supply and sewage systems to the development of HE epidemic process and the regulating role of infectious immunological mechanisms in the development of HA epidemic process were demonstrated."
8,"Community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A in Latvia, in 2008.","Since November 2007, an increase in the number of reported hepatitis A cases has been observed in Latvia. The aim of this report is to provide an update on the descriptive epidemiology of hepatitis A in Latvia and suggest some possible explanations of the recent increase in incidence."
9,Prophylaxis for hepatitis A.,"Hepatitis A is a common communicable disease in this country. Each diagnosed case of hepatitis A involves the problem of selecting contacts for post-exposure immunoglobulin. These decisions should be systematic, based on current knowledge of epidemiology, kinetics of viral excretion by infected persons and the influence of time on the efficacy of immunoglobulin prophylaxis. An algorithm incorporates this information into a strategy consistent with the United States Public Health Service guidelines."
