0,Hepatitis A.,"Hepatitis A remains an important cause of community-acquired hepatitis in the United States and in the world. In recent years, improvements in personal hygiene and environmental sanitation have led to declines in overall hepatitis A infection rates in developed countries, although sporadic outbreaks still occur with similar rates of hospitalization and loss of work. Therapy remains supportive and prevention holds the key to elimination of widespread infection. Acute infection can be prevented or attenuated with IG or with inactivated, highly immunogenic vaccines. Elderly persons and those with advanced liver disease are at higher risk of the consequences of acute HAV, and they represent target populations for immediate vaccination. Challenges for the future include strategies for broad-based population vaccination, including cost-effective approaches."
1,An estimate of the incidence of hepatitis A in unimmunized Canadian travelers to developing countries.,"Background: There is a paucity of data describing the risk of acquiring hepatitis A while traveling in the developing world. This paper uses available data to calculate the risk to Canadian travelers. Methods: Information was gathered from Canadian and international sources on the following: the yearly incidence of hepatitis A among Canadians; the proportion of cases of hepatitis A associated with travel to developing countries; the number of days of such travel by Canadians per year; and the percentage of travelers immunized before departure. Calculations were performed on these figures to arrive at an estimated risk of infection for unimmunized Canadian travelers. Results: The annual incidence of hepatitis A in Canada over the period 1996-2001, adjusted for underreporting, averaged 6.15 cases/100,000 people. During that time, Canadians traveled approximately 36.5 million days/year in developing countries. The literature shows that 4% to 28% (mean 16%) of cases are estimated to have been acquired abroad. It also shows that 14% to 24% (mean 19%) of such travelers are immunized before departure. Based on these figures, the risk of acquiring hepatitis A during 1 month of travel in the developing world is calculated to be approximately 1 case per 3,000 unimmunized travelers. Conclusion: Hepatitis A is an important travel-related disease, preventable by immunization. However, our calculations indicate that the risk of acquiring hepatitis A while traveling in the developing world is lower than some previously published estimates. The results represent an average for all types of travel to all such countries. The actual risk will vary considerably, depending on the destination and style of travel."
2,[Inactivated vaccine against hepatitis A: review of the literature and considerations on its use].,"A new, safe, highly immunogenic and probably long term effective inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine has been licensed for clinical use. Clinical trials in developed countries have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing hepatitis A in high risk groups, such as travelers to regions where HAV infection is endemic and day care children and staff, its efficacy in postexposure conditions and in community outbreaks. The authors review the basic and changing features of the disease and its epidemiology in specific geographical regions trying to elucidate its use in the control of the disease in developing countries, especially in Brazil. Taking in consideration its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine may be of extreme value in terms of individual protection. Because this vaccine is so new, there are no formal recommendations for its use in developing countries, and appropriate public health use of hepatitis A vaccine requires up-to-date epidemiological information."
3,Emerging risk for viral hepatitis A in Croatian adults.,"An objective of the study was to determine the changes in the risk of developing hepatitis A in the 30-years period and discuss the need for vaccination against HAV infection in Croatia and the city of Rijeka comparing incidence of hepatitis A between 1970-1974 and 2000-2004 periods. Hepatitis A declined in both populations and affected more prominently older population groups. Improvement of hygiene and sanitary conditions appears to have decreased hepatitis A incidence among children and adults, but only a seroepidemiological study can give more accurate data as a basis for discussion on the necessity of vaccination as a further measure in reducing hepatitis A incidence."
4,Hepatitis A: a preventable threat.,"Hepatitis A is a major public health problem, particularly in the pediatric population. Although hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease, it is associated with significant morbidity. The virus is transmitted primarily by person-to-person contact via the fecal-oral route. The infection can be inapparent, subclinical, anicteric, or icteric. In general, the severity of the disease is inversely correlated with the age of the child. Occasionally, fulminant hepatitis, which is associated with a high mortality rate, may result. The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A is most commonly made through the detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-hepatitis A antibody. Treatment is generally supportive. General preventive measures include improved standards of hygiene and sanitation. Universal childhood vaccination is the most effective method for eradicating hepatitis A and preventing its transmission."
5,"Source identification through social networks in an epidemiological investigation of a hepatitis A outbreak at an elementary school in Anhui province, China.","In May 2011, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of a Chinese county found a rapid increase in the number of hepatitis A case notification; these were traced to an outbreak in an elementary school. Twenty-eight cases aged between 7 and 13 years with onset between 7 May and 8 June were serologically confirmed. Network method was conducted to reconstruct an outbreak network and to quantify the relative importance of those involved in the outbreak. A case-control study was used to study the association between the outbreak and putative risk factors. The network analysis suggested this was a disseminated outbreak originating from a 4-year-old boy with propagated spread. Evidence from the case-control study supported consumption of well water as a potential risk factor; however, this was unable to be established through field investigation. Outbreak networks can be used to identify the possible source of infectious disease outbreak, especially when the environmental investigation information is negative or not available."
6,Prevention of hepatitis A and B.,"The vaccine preventable hepatitides, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, cause a great burden of illness in both developing and industrialized nations. There is increased community awareness of the problems of viral hepatitis, and it is important for general practitioners to be aware of current recommendations for prevention of hepatitis A and B."
7,Clinical features of re-emerging hepatitis A: an analysis of patients hospitalized during an urban epidemic in Korea.,"From April 2008 to November 2008, many cases of hepatitis A were reported in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province in Korea. Furthermore, the rate of severe or fulminant hepatitis have significantly increased during the latest epidemic (13.4% vs. 5.2%, p=0.044). Therefore, widespread use of vaccine is warranted to reduce the burden of hepatitis A in Korea."
8,"Outbreak of hepatitis A among men who have sex with men in Barcelona, Spain, September 2008-March 2009.","Between 1 September 2008 and 9 March 2009, 150 cases of hepatitis A were reported in Barcelona representing a threefold increase compared with the same period in previous two years. The majority of the cases occurred in adult men, including 87 who reported having sex with men. This indicated the possibility of an outbreak ongoing in the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) and emphasised the need to target this community with more effective vaccination programmes."
9,Hepatitis A: post-exposure prophylaxis.,We report on the findings of an exploratory review of evidence published in English from 1945 to identify the best post-exposure prophylaxis treatment and the longest acceptable interval after exposure for prophylaxis to be effective. We found no evidence that post-exposure administration of currently available immunoglobulins is effective in preventing hepatitis A infection and disease. The use of immunoglobulins for immunoprophylaxis should not be widely recommended until a systematic review of the evidence has been conducted. We recommend that active immunization to secondary contacts of exposed and vaccinated subjects be offered.
