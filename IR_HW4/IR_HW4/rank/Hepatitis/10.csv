0,Landmark perspective: Landmarks in viral hepatitis.,"Developments in viral hepatitis have been traced from Saul Krugman's distinction of two types, MS1 and MS2 (A and B), and Baruch S. Blumberg's discovery of Australia antigen. Hepatitis A has been grown in tissue culture, the structure of the virus is known, and the acute disease can be diagnosed. Knowledge of the molecular biology of the more complex hepatitis B virion has allowed the development of an effective vaccine and distinction of replicative and nonreplicative stages of infection. Integration, in the hepatocyte, of hepatitis B viral DNA into host DNA is the precursor of liver cancer. The infection of hepatitis B carriers with another infectious agent, delta, has added a new dimension to the problem. Other unidentified causes of hepatitis have been lumped together as non-A, non-B, and these remain to be defined and accurately diagnosed."
1,"[Viral hepatitis A, E and their mix (A+E) in children].","Results are submitted of clinical-and-laboratory examination of 528 children with viral hepatitides A and E. Comparative analysis has been performed of clinical manifestations of the disease, biochemical indices, and outcome. In concurrent infection caused by hepatitis A and E viruses, the pathologic process was shown to run a graver course."
2,Posttravel hepatitis A: probable acquisition from an asymptomatic adopted child.,"We report a case of acute hepatitis A in an adoptive parent that was probably acquired from a recently adopted child with asymptomatic, active infection. Prospective adoptive parents should be protected against hepatitis A because of potential exposure during travel and the risk of unrecognized active infection in adopted children."
3,Acute renal failure in non-fulminant hepatitis A infection.,"A 7-year-old boy developed acute renal failure during the icteric phase of non-fulminant hepatitis A infection. He needed peritoneal dialysis for 3 days, which was followed by a rapid recovery in renal function which was normal when he was discharged 4 weeks later."
4,[Monoclonal antibodies in human hepatitis A virus immunoenzyme diagnosis].,"Antigen and antibody detection in EIA is a good tool in diagnosing HAV infections, especially in their differentiation from other hepatitides. Commercial kits containing polyclonal antibodies and murine MAbs to identify HAV are now available. Rat MAbs have not been assayed so far. Peroxidase-labelled rat MAbs and purified rat MAbs as antigen capture were used to modify commercial ""VectoHep A-IgM"" and ""VectorHep A-Ag"" kits. The results obtained with modified ""VectoHep A-IgM"" and ""VectorHep A-Ag"" kits with labelled rat MAbs suggest that labelled rat MAbs can increase the sensitivity and specificity of EIA. MAbs used as antigen capture and labelled antibodies permit at least an 8-fold increase in sensitivity as compared to polyclonal antibodies. The modified ""VectorHep A-Ag"" kit with labelled rat MAbs provided 100% sensitivity and specificity in EIA. The modified ""VectorHep A-Ag"" kit also allowed the authors to determine viral antigens in the cell lysate, homogenates of the infected monkey liver, stools from patients, and sewage water samples. The rat MAbs modified kits can be recommended for using in epidemiological and clinical studies of HAV infections."
5,[Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis A virus].,"The genome of hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a linear plus-strand RNA molecule of 7,500 nucleotides and it shares common strategies of construction and function of the picornavirus family. Since it has a unique nucleotide sequence homology, HAV has been classified in the genus of hepatovirus, newly added to the family. Nucleotide sequence of the putative VP1/2A junction area was found variable and a 168 nucleotide portion of the region has been compared with many HAV sequences obtained from all over the world. It was found that HAV strains could be identified and classified into 7 genotypes or 9 subgenotypes. Analyses of the nucleotide sequence homology of this particular region is useful, not only in the study of epidemiology of hepatitis A, but also in the study of the molecular epidemiology of HAV."
6,Fulminant hepatitis A.,"During a small epidemic of infectious hepatitis, a fulminant infection with fatal outcome occurred in a 54-year-old woman. IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus was demonstrated in the serum and large amounts of hepatitis A virus were found in the liver. It is suggested that the pathogenesis may be different for fulminant hepatitis A and B infection."
7,Vaccination strategies against hepatitis A in southern Europe.,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is decreasing in southern European countries, where epidemiological conditions vary among regions depending on the social and health-care system development. In high endemic settings, HAV infection has not heavy social and economic weight while in countries with a moderate/low degree of endemia there is a call for targeted vaccination policy. In countries, like Spain and in Italy, where several studies confirm an increase in susceptible adults, vaccination strategies have been applied and recommendations have been published about hepatitis A prevention. Universal hepatitis A immunization seems economically unattractive and most evidences for targeted vaccination have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Vaccine should be used to protect travellers to countries where HAV infection is a major risk and in preventing secondary cases and outbreaks."
8,Some observations on viral hepatitis.,"Epidemiologic patterns of viral hepatitis continue to change over time. Our understanding of its behavior began to change with the recognition that multiple distinct etiologic agents (hepatitis viruses A, B, and non-A/non-B) produce similar clinical syndromes and that there is a broad variability of age-related host response to infection with a given agent. Dorothy Horstmann was among the first to point to the relative mildness of symptoms in children and to the potential epidemiologic significance of such infections. Although hepatitis type A appears to be on a steady decline in overall national incidence, there is an increasing recognition of adult cases epidemiologically related to relatively mild or inapparent infections among infants and children attending day-care centers."
9,Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral hepatitis A in Italy.,"Viral hepatitis A is still common in Italy, especially in Southern regions. In this study, a metapopulation model for hepatitis A virus (HAV) transmission is proposed and analyzed. Analytical results on the asymptotic and transient behaviors of the system are carried out. Based on the available Italian movement data, a national spatial contact matrix at the regional level, which could be used for new studies on the transmission dynamics of other infectious diseases, is derived for modeling fluxes of individuals. Despite the small number of fitted parameters, model simulations are in good agreement with the observed average HAV incidence in all regions. Our results suggest that the mass vaccination program introduced in one Italian region only (Puglia, the one with the highest endemicity level) could have played a role in the decline of HAV incidence in the country as a whole. The only notable exception is represented by Campania, a Southern region showing a high endemicity level, which is not substantially affected by HAV dynamics in Puglia. Finally, our results highlight that the continuation of the vaccination campaign in Puglia would have a relevant impact in decreasing long-term HAV prevalence, especially in Southern Italy."
