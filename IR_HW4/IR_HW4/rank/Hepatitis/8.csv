0,[Viral hepatitis A and B in anthropoid apes of the Moscow Zoo].,"The rate of occurrence of hepatitis A and B virus specific markers in anthropoid apes of the Moscow Zoo (3 chimpanzees, 3 gorillas, 8 orang-outangs) was studied. Long-term persistence of HBs-antigen in orang-outang accompanied by the presence of HBe-antigen and anti-HBs was demonstrated. The presence of anti-HBs in gorillas and orang-outangs was recorded. Antibodies to hepatitis A virus were found in all the animal species examined. Cases of acute virus hepatitis A in orang-outangs are described contracted from the personnel handling the animals and suffering from this type of hepatitis. Morphological features of the course of hepatitis A in the presence of HBs-antigen carrier state are described. The possibility of active immunization of susceptible animals and the personnel of the zoo against viral hepatitides is discussed."
1,[Hepatitis A and a grill bar].,"A small outbreak of hepatitis A infection in October 1988 involving 11 patients is described, together with the history of the suspected index case. Six to eight weeks before the onset of disease, all patients had consumed one or several meals containing elements of uncooked food in a local grill bar in the Copenhagen county area. The virus had probably been imported from Egypt. Public sanitation authorities were alerted immediately after the first suspicion was raised."
2,The prevalence of hepatitis A and B in Norwegian merchant seamen--a serological study.,"The prevalence of viral hepatitis in Norwegian merchant seamen in overseas trade was studied in 523 volunteers during compulsory health control before embarkation from the port of Oslo. The prevalence of hepatitis B markers was 9.4%, which is significantly higher than in the general Norwegian population. The prevalence increased with the number of years of occupation. It was associated with frequent casual sexual contacts in foreign countries, but not significantly increased in participants who had been exposed to tattooing or different types of medical treatment under poor hygienic conditions in foreign areas. The prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A (HAV) was 36% in seamen born in 1945 or earlier and 5% in younger individuals, an age-dependent pattern which is essentially similar in the general Norwegian population. However, the prevalence of hepatitis A antibodies seemed to increase with years in foreign trade. The incidence of viral hepatitis infections in the occupation was noticeably high, suggesting that vaccination of seamen in certain areas of trade should be considered."
3,Present knowledge of viral hepatitis.,"The term viral hepatitis refers to the diseases produced by at least three, and perhaps four or five aetiologic agents that differ in their virologic characteristics, ecologic mechanisms, epidemiologic patterns, and long term consequences. These divergences are now well-defined for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). HAV is an RNA virus dependent upon consecutive transmission in childhood, and is not associated with long term sequelae. In contrast, HBV is a DNA virus capable of producing a reservoir of chronic human infection from which spread to adults as well as children can periodically occur by a variety of methods. Chronic HBV disease is not only a continuing source of potential viral transmission in the community, but also sometimes results years later in very serious consequences. Continuing destruction of the liver leads to cirrhosis and hepatic failure; in addition, integration of viral DNA into that of the hepatocyte is probably responsible for the high incidence of carcinoma of the liver associated with HBV infection in many areas of the world. The 'third' form of viral hepatitis is termed 'non-A, non-B' (NANB), because it is identified only by serologic exclusion of HAV and HBV infection. Its epidemiologic and clinical characterization are difficult because variations in behaviour in groups of cases suggest that more than one virus is responsible for this negatively defined entity. One or more of the agents leads to chronic infection, but the relative frequency with which it causes chronic active hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma cannot yet be stated."
4,[Acute and chronic viral hepatitis in childhood. A review].,"The author reviews nomenclature, pathogenetic agents, immunological markers and mode of infection of hepatitis in childhood. Epidemiology, incubation period, prejaundiced phase, clinic and course in regard to different types of viral hepatitis are characterised. Especially jaundiced and nonjaundiced courses, biochemical parameters immunological diagnosis of hepatitis type A and type B respectively are emphasized together with histological and histologic-immunological criteria. Therapy and prophylaxis of A- and B-hepatitis are discussed. The author reports on the chronic, chronic-persisting and chronic-active form of the hepatitis including immunological markers, auto-antibodies and therapy."
5,Severe acute pancreatitis due to hepatitis A virus infection in a patient of acute viral hepatitis.,"The commonest causes of acute pancreatitis are cholelithiasis and alcohol. Rare causes include various viral infections, among which mumps is the commonest. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and, recently, hepatitis E have been reported to cause acute but mild pancreatitis in patients with acute viral hepatitis. This report describes a case of severe acute pancreatitis caused by hepatitis A."
6,"[The epidemiological diagnosis of ""fecal-oral"" hepatitis E in Tajikistan].","On the basis of the results of the retrospective epidemiological analysis of hepatitis A morbidity for many years in the Leninabad (now Hojend) region of Tajikistan the possibility of the epidemiological diagnosis of fecal-oral hepatitis non A, non B, also known as hepatitis E, was confirmed. Analysis of the specific features of a sharp morbidity rise in hepatitis A in this region in 1986-1987 made it possible to establish that this rise was caused by hepatitis E. This was testified by the explosive character of morbidity; the prevalence of persons aged 15-29 years, found to have antibodies to hepatitis A virus in 95% of cases (among patients, these persons constituted 67.5% of the total number of hepatitis A patients and children of preschool age constituted only 8.8% of such patients); sharply pronounced irregularity in the distribution of morbidity in individual settlements, depending on the state of water supply; a low number of the foci of infection in patient's families; the unfavorable course of the disease in pregnant women with high mortality rate (19%) among them. Similar epidemiological features were noted in hepatitis E outbreaks, occurring at the same period in the adjoining regions in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, where the etiology of the disease was established by excluding the markers of hepatitides A and B in most of the patients. Some data indicate that the causes of these outbreaks of hepatitis E were linked with the water route of the transmission of hepatitis E virus."
7,Viral hepatitis--a primer: 1. Epidem.iology.,"Hepatitis A is most often transmitted by the fecal-oral route under conditions of crowding, poor hygiene, and prolonged exposure to infected persons. Direct spread of hepatitis B via person-to person contact has only recently been proved. Hepatitis B is usually transmitted indirectly proved. Hepatitis B is usually transmitted indirectly by percutaneous routes, and the increase in drug abuse has brought about a change in its epidemiologic pattern."
8,[Hepatitis A in Denmark. Notified cases 1996-1999].,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to describe the incidence of hepatitis A in Denmark with the emphasis on the role of immigrants in relation to transmission and prevention of the disease. Method: A retrospective study of notified cases of hepatitis A during the period, 1.1.1996-31.12.1999. Results: A total of 398 notified cases were examined, 45% of which occurred in immigrants. The average incidence per year was 13.2 per 100,000 for immigrants and 1.1 per 100,000 for Danes. The incidence for immigrants from Pakistan and Turkey was 4-5 times that for immigrants as a whole. The median age in immigrants was eight years and in Danes 29 years. Immigrants were hospitalised in 35% of the cases. Of children below ten years of age 31% were admitted. Danes were hospitalised in 43% of the cases, and of children below ten years of age 44% were admitted. Infection was acquired abroad for 71% of immigrants, 49% of whom visited Pakistan or Turkey. Of those infected in Denmark, person-to-person transmission was the most common mode of infection for both groups. Immigrants who had been travelling to endemic areas were involved in 21 of 34 outbreaks. Conclusion: The incidence of hepatitis A in Denmark seems to relate highly to the children of immigrants, who come from high endemic areas. Vaccination of those above one year of age is recommended when travelling abroad if anticipated. Economic compensation could be considered."
9,[Serodiagnosis of acute hepatitis A].,"Hepatitis A antibody (anti-HAV) was detected by specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) method in sera from 10 patients with acute icteric hepatitis. Anti-HAV was detectable in many subjects very early before the onset of jaundice, but the diagnosis of type A hepatitis in all patients was confirmed by the demonstration of seroconversion during convalescence. Since the initial antibody detected by RIA is predominantly IgM, while IgG specific anti-HAV appears later reaching peak levels within 1 to 2 months, we treated serum specimens of these patients with 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) in order to differentiate acute-from convalescent-phase hepatitis A sera. Inactivation of IgM fraction with 2ME produced a significant reduction of anti-HAV titer only in acute-phase sera, so that this procedure may be used for early diagnosis of acute type A hepatitis."
