0,Patterns of viral hepatitis in Hong Kong.,"Viral hepatitis is the most common form of acute or chronic hepatitis in Hong Kong. This article outlines current patterns of viral hepatitis in Hong Kong, and discusses the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the different forms of the disease."
1,An estimate of the incidence of hepatitis A in unimmunized Canadian travelers to developing countries.,"Background: There is a paucity of data describing the risk of acquiring hepatitis A while traveling in the developing world. This paper uses available data to calculate the risk to Canadian travelers. Methods: Information was gathered from Canadian and international sources on the following: the yearly incidence of hepatitis A among Canadians; the proportion of cases of hepatitis A associated with travel to developing countries; the number of days of such travel by Canadians per year; and the percentage of travelers immunized before departure. Calculations were performed on these figures to arrive at an estimated risk of infection for unimmunized Canadian travelers. Results: The annual incidence of hepatitis A in Canada over the period 1996-2001, adjusted for underreporting, averaged 6.15 cases/100,000 people. During that time, Canadians traveled approximately 36.5 million days/year in developing countries. The literature shows that 4% to 28% (mean 16%) of cases are estimated to have been acquired abroad. It also shows that 14% to 24% (mean 19%) of such travelers are immunized before departure. Based on these figures, the risk of acquiring hepatitis A during 1 month of travel in the developing world is calculated to be approximately 1 case per 3,000 unimmunized travelers. Conclusion: Hepatitis A is an important travel-related disease, preventable by immunization. However, our calculations indicate that the risk of acquiring hepatitis A while traveling in the developing world is lower than some previously published estimates. The results represent an average for all types of travel to all such countries. The actual risk will vary considerably, depending on the destination and style of travel."
2,[Inactivated vaccine against hepatitis A: review of the literature and considerations on its use].,"A new, safe, highly immunogenic and probably long term effective inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine has been licensed for clinical use. Clinical trials in developed countries have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing hepatitis A in high risk groups, such as travelers to regions where HAV infection is endemic and day care children and staff, its efficacy in postexposure conditions and in community outbreaks. The authors review the basic and changing features of the disease and its epidemiology in specific geographical regions trying to elucidate its use in the control of the disease in developing countries, especially in Brazil. Taking in consideration its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine may be of extreme value in terms of individual protection. Because this vaccine is so new, there are no formal recommendations for its use in developing countries, and appropriate public health use of hepatitis A vaccine requires up-to-date epidemiological information."
3,"Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Update on testing and treatment.","Five major types of viral hepatitis have been identified. Hepatitis A is an acute, usually self-limited illness. Prophylaxis with immune globulin (Gamastan, Gammar) is effective in household and sexual contacts of infected patients. Hepatitis B has both acute and chronic forms. Treatment trials for chronic hepatitis B with interferon alfa-2b have shown promise. Hepatitis C is the name now given to non-A non-B hepatitis. Interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) has been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis D occurs only in patients with hepatitis B. The only treatment for hepatitis D is prevention of hepatitis B. Hepatitis E is seen after natural disasters in developing regions of the world. Further advances in serologic testing and treatment of viral hepatitis can be expected."
4,Emerging risk for viral hepatitis A in Croatian adults.,"An objective of the study was to determine the changes in the risk of developing hepatitis A in the 30-years period and discuss the need for vaccination against HAV infection in Croatia and the city of Rijeka comparing incidence of hepatitis A between 1970-1974 and 2000-2004 periods. Hepatitis A declined in both populations and affected more prominently older population groups. Improvement of hygiene and sanitary conditions appears to have decreased hepatitis A incidence among children and adults, but only a seroepidemiological study can give more accurate data as a basis for discussion on the necessity of vaccination as a further measure in reducing hepatitis A incidence."
5,"Source identification through social networks in an epidemiological investigation of a hepatitis A outbreak at an elementary school in Anhui province, China.","In May 2011, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of a Chinese county found a rapid increase in the number of hepatitis A case notification; these were traced to an outbreak in an elementary school. Twenty-eight cases aged between 7 and 13 years with onset between 7 May and 8 June were serologically confirmed. Network method was conducted to reconstruct an outbreak network and to quantify the relative importance of those involved in the outbreak. A case-control study was used to study the association between the outbreak and putative risk factors. The network analysis suggested this was a disseminated outbreak originating from a 4-year-old boy with propagated spread. Evidence from the case-control study supported consumption of well water as a potential risk factor; however, this was unable to be established through field investigation. Outbreak networks can be used to identify the possible source of infectious disease outbreak, especially when the environmental investigation information is negative or not available."
6,[Hepatitis A and E enterically transmitted virus infections of the liver].,"Hepatitis A virus (a picornavirus) and hepatitis E virus (so far unclassified) are small, non-enveloped and relatively stable RNA viruses with many similar, yet, not identical characteristics. Both viruses are transmitted preferentially by the fecal-oral route. Consequently, their spread is favoured by poor personal hygiene and inappropriate sanitary conditions. Infection can pass subclinically, take an acute and self limiting course, and can also manifest as fulminant hepatitis with liver failure. True chronic disease is unknown. Laboratory diagnosis is preferentially performed by serology, but can also be complemented by assay for viral RNA in stool or serum. Resolution of infection leads to immunity which, in the case of hepatitis A, is known to be fully protective and most likely lifelong. Available hepatitis A vaccines are able to induce a similar state of protection. Vaccines for hepatitis E are under development. Specific antiviral treatment is not yet available, neither for hepatitis A nor for hepatitis E."
7,Hepatitis A: old and new.,"The hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus, is a common cause of hepatitis worldwide. Spread of infection is generally person to person or by oral intake after fecal contamination of skin or mucous membranes; less commonly, there is fecal contamination of food or water. Hepatitis A is endemic in developing countries, and most residents are exposed in childhood. In contrast, the adult population in developed countries demonstrates falling rates of exposure with improvements in hygiene and sanitation. The export of food that cannot be sterilized, from countries of high endemicity to areas with low rates of infection, is a potentially important source of infection. After ingestion and uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, the virus replicates in the liver and is excreted into the bile. Cellular immune responses to the virus lead to destruction of infected hepatocytes with consequent development of symptoms and signs of disease. Humoral immune responses are the basis for diagnostic serologic assays. Acute HAV infection is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of acute viral hepatitis. In young children the disease is often asymptomatic, whereas in older children and adults there may be a range of clinical manifestations from mild, anicteric infection to fulminant hepatic failure. Clinical variants include prolonged, relapsing, and cholestatic forms. Management of the acute illness is supportive, and complete recovery without sequelae is the usual outcome. Research efforts during World War II led to the development of passive immunoprophylaxis. Pooled immune serum globulin is efficacious in the prevention and attenuation of disease in exposed individuals. More recently, active immunoprophylaxis by vaccination has been accomplished. Future eradication of this disease can now be contemplated."
8,"Viral hepatitis in the 1990s, Part I: Current principles of management.","Recent years have brought major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis. Treatment of acute uncomplicated hepatitis is supportive rather than curative. Treatment of fulminant hepatic necrosis is directed towards preventing and treating complications while preparing suitable patients for liver transplantation. Corticosteroids do not improve survival rates in patients with fulminant hepatic necrosis and should be avoided in nearly all patients with hepatitis A. Although liver histology in acute viral hepatitis is highly characteristic, biopsy is usually superfluous, except in transplant patients with acute hepatic dysfunction. Hepatitis A virus infection is frequently asymptomatic, and data on its incidence are poor. The virus is frequently transmitted before the patient becomes ill; therefore, curtailing hepatitis A spread depends in large measure on hygienic practices. Passive immunization is possible with immune globulin. Inactivated and attenuated vaccines may be licensed within the next 2 years."
9,Prevention of hepatitis A and B.,"The vaccine preventable hepatitides, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, cause a great burden of illness in both developing and industrialized nations. There is increased community awareness of the problems of viral hepatitis, and it is important for general practitioners to be aware of current recommendations for prevention of hepatitis A and B."
