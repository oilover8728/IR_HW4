0,"[Hepatitis A--results of the analysis of 3,111 hospitalized patients].","The results of the analysis of 3.111 patients admitted to the hospital with hepatitis A (HA) were reported. The serodiagnosis of acute type A hepatitis was confirmed by presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) detected by solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA HAVAB-M, Abbott). The majority of patients were between 11-15 (24%) and 21-30 (25%) years of age and even 15% of a total number were older than 30 years. The number of males and females with HA was not significantly different and the minority of patients were admitted during the summer. A few of the admitted patients had a history of anicteric form of the disease (14%), while most (80%) were icteric. Only 6% of the affected patients had severe form of HA and no fulminant form of hepatitis among them occurred. The relapsing HA (RHA) was observed even in 308 (10%) of the patients, which did not alter the benign prognosis of HA. Forty three chronic HBV carriers were found to be infected with HAV and this did not cause more severe disease or influence adversely the course of chronic HBV infection. Nine pregnant women with HA in the third trimester of pregnancy had no severe form of the disease, but HA significantly increased the average incidence of prematurity (27%:10%). Although HA is neither severe illness nor one with important sequelae, it remains a frequent cause of morbidity. Therefore, a wide program of effective vaccination should be applied."
1,Persistent hepatitis A infection: case report.,Hepatitis A viral infection resolves completely within six months in all patients infected. The case presented is a rare one that took fifteen months to resolve from hepatitis A viral infection.
2,[Hepatitis A in drug addicts].,"In the years 1982-1988 among patients admitted with the diagnosis of acute virus hepatitis to the Department of Infectious Hepatology, Institute of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases in Warsaw were 25 drug addicts. In 15 of them virus hepatitis B and in 10 virus hepatitis A was recognized. Virus hepatitis A had in the group of addicts a milder course than in controls not taking narcotics."
3,[Viral hepatitis type A as an important all-clinical problem].,"The article contains present-day data on type A viral hepatitis, whose incidence in Russia has increased significantly in the recent years. The authors consider the pathogenesis of type A hepatitis, taking into account the peculiarities of immune response to the virus. Clinical manifestations of various variants, including anicteric one and combinations of type A hepatitis with hepatites of other etiologies, are described. The authors stress the diagnostical significance of anti-HAV IgM detection, the aspects of differential diagnosis, treatment, as well as specific and non-specific prophylaxis of type A viral hepatitis."
4,Reports of clinical hepatitis A from Public Health and hospital microbiology laboratories to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre during the period 1980-1988.,"Clinical hepatitis, diagnosed as being caused by virus type A by tests for specific immunoglobulin M, has been reported from laboratories in England, Wales and Ireland since 1980. There were 25541 reports in the following 9 years, a yearly average of 2838. A 7-year cycle is suggested by peaks in the numbers of reports of 4502 in 1982 and 4167 in 1988 with a continuing rise in 1989. Contact with other cases of acute hepatitis was recorded for 3899 patients (15%) of which 2497 (64%) were in families, 258 (7%) were in schools, 94 (2%) were in institutions/hospitals, 197 (5%) were in the neighbourhood, while 140 (4%) were contacts at work or socially. A possible food source was recorded for 122 (3%) with shellfish being specified in 56 cases. Recent travel abroad was reported for 3692 patients (15%) of whom 3027 (82%) had visited areas of high prevalence for hepatitis A. About half of them had been to the Indian sub-continent, in strong contrast to visits abroad by the general population each year of which only 7% of the 22 million visits are to areas of high prevalence for hepatitis A. Association with the Indian sub-continent was particularly high for children."
5,"Hepatitis A virus infections in travelers, 1988-2004.","Background: Uncertainty exists about the current risk of hepatitis A virus infection in nonimmune travelers to destinations with high or intermediate risk of transmission. We analyzed recent epidemiological data on imported hepatitis A to determine region-specific attack rates and incidences. Methods: Surveillance data on hepatitis A virus infections diagnosed during 1988-2004 were evaluated on the basis of notification by laboratories, additional reports of physicians, and traveler's statistics. This study focuses on international travelers with hepatitis A virus infection detected after their return to Switzerland. Results: The rate of imported hepatitis A virus infections decreased 75% from 1988 to 2004 and accounted overall for 42% of all hepatitis A cases reported in Switzerland. The actual incidence of hepatitis A in travelers to countries of high or intermediate risk of transmission was 3.0-11.0 per 100,000 person-months abroad for all travelers and 6.0-28.0 per 100,000 for those presumed to be nonimmune. The actual proportion of those visiting friends and relatives among patients with hepatitis A has increased to 28.2%, with children aged 0-14 years predominating. Reductions in the incidence by hepatitis A vaccination were estimated to vary between 35.0% and 61.8% for different destinations. Conclusions: The risk of hepatitis A virus infections has decreased by a factor of 10-50-fold over time, compared with findings from older studies. The risk, however, remains very considerable at many destinations, including frequently visited places, such as Mexico. Children of immigrants are a high-risk population. Strategies are needed to reach those at highest risk."
6,Viral hepatitis in homosexual men.,"We studied 33 episodes of acute viral hepatitis in homosexual men to determine the type of hepatitis seen in this population. Seventy percent were caused by type A hepatitis, and 30% by type B hepatitis. None were due to non-A, non-B hepatitis. A high proportion of patients presenting with either type of acute hepatitis had evidence of previous infection with the other type: Seventy percent of patients with type B hepatitis had previous infection with type A, and 74% of patients with type A hepatitis had previous infection with type B. This study shows that, in homosexual men, hepatitis A, like hepatitis B, is a sexually transmitted disease."
7,[Etiologic structure of viral hepatitis in children based on data from an comprehensive serologic study of hospitalized patients].,"During a year an overall serological examination of 1,200 children hospitalized with the diagnosis of viral hepatitis was carried out with a view to establish the presence of hepatitis A and hepatitis B markers (anti-HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and anti-HBe IgM) by means of the enzyme immunoassay and radioimmunoassay. The average annual proportion of cases of hepatitis A (61.4%), hepatitis B (20.4%), hepatitis non A, non B (11.2%) and mixed infection (7.0%) among children, as well as seasonal and age-group fluctuations of this proportion, were established. The etiological structure of viral hepatitides, based on commonly accepted clinico-epidemiological diagnostic criteria, was shown to differ from their true etiological structure as determined in accordance with specific serological markers detected in this investigation."
8,[Acute viral hepatitis A and C: report of a case].,"We present a case of acute hepatitis by simultaneous A and C virus infection. The coinfection was suspected due to the high levels of transaminases lasting more than 9 months after onset of the illness. During the early stages of the illness, the patient had IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus. Serological tests for hepatitis B and C viruses, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Bar virus were negative. Due to the persistently high transaminase levels, we repeated the serology, detecting positive results for hepatitis C antibody, while hepatitis B serology remained negative as well that for all other virus tested. With these findings, we believe that a patient with hepatitis A of long duration, requires additional serological examinations to determine the possibility of coinfection by another virus."
9,[Adult giant cell hepatitis with fatal outcome. Clinicopathologic case report and reflections on pathogenesis].,"The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes. In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia. Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult gaint cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer. In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses. Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection. These both indicate an infectious cause. However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees. Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically. In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient. This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here."
