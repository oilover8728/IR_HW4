0,Outbreak of hepatitis A infection among intravenous drug users in Suffolk and suspected risk factors.,"A prolonged outbreak of hepatitis A infection amongst drug users in Suffolk prompted a study of the natural immunity against hepatitis A in this population, and a retrospective analysis of the relationship between specific drug-taking behaviours and the risk of hepatitis A infection. Prior to the outbreak, age-specific seroprevalence of hepatitis A IgG in drug users was similar to that amongst blood donors in the region. Of those without effective immunity, intravenous drug users, multiple drug users and those injecting frequently were more likely to have developed hepatitis. The reported frequency of equipment sharing and the number of injecting partners were not related to the risk of infection. The potential for blood-to-blood, and a suggested faecal-blood transmission were considered to be important in propagating the outbreak in this population. We suggest that a single dose of hepatitis A vaccine administered opportunistically should be used in outbreaks involving drug users."
1,[Water and viral hepatitis].,"The main agents responsible for acute viral hepatitis throughout the world are the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Both are transmitted by fecal-oral route and can provoke large epidemics, HAV in developed countries and HEV in developing countries. Water is a major vehicle of spread. However, two different epidemiological patterns have to be distinguished: level of HAV excretion is short but high. Because of its resistance to physical and chemical agents, HAV remains infectious for a long time under environmental conditions. Progress in hygiene have nearly stopped the circulation of HAV in industrialized countries, making populations more susceptible to the infection and increasing the epidemic risk. Conventional measures sometimes fail to prevent HAV infections. Vaccine is currently the best way for hepatitis A prophylaxis; HEV is excreted briefly and at low concentrations. Viral particles are fragile in vitro and their viability in environment is not yet understood. Epidemics mainly occur in countries with poor sanitary conditions, resulting from heavy water pollutions. High case-fatality rates are observed, especially among pregnant women. The control of enterically transmitted viral hepatitis remains a major public health challenge. Virological surveillance of waste water could improve strategies based on hygiene, sanitation and supply of drinking water."
2,Case report: severe respiratory alkalosis--unusual manifestation of viral hepatitis.,"A middle-aged man who had been in good general health presented with marked hyperventilation and severe respiratory alkalosis. Typical signs and symptoms of viral hepatitis subsequently developed. Investigation showed that he and 32 other patients with hepatitis had all eaten at the same restaurant prior to illness. Because of his distressing constitutional symptoms and markedly elevated hepatic enzyme levels, corticosteroid therapy was begun. The symptoms and hyperventilation improved dramatically. Although respiratory alkalosis has been observed during the course of other infectious diseases, to our knowledge it has not previously been reported in association with hepatitis A infection."
3,Acute hepatitis A infection in children: a 20-year experience of a medical center in Southern Taiwan.,"Background: Taiwan is currently nonendemic for hepatitis A infection, but sporadic cases are reported occasionally. The presenting symptoms of acute hepatitis A (AHA) infection in children are often nonspecific and may be easily misdiagnosed as general gastrointestinal illness. Methods: We conducted this study to identify the relevant presenting symptoms and laboratory findings of AHA in children. The medical records of all patients younger than 18 years old admitted to Kaohsiung Chang Gang Memorial Hospital from July 1986 to June 2004 under the diagnosis of AHA were reviewed. There were 29 pediatric patients admitted with the diagnosis of AHA, including 16 male patients and 13 female patients. Results: Poor appetite, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever were the leading constitutional symptoms. Jaundice and tea-colored urine were the most relevant hepatobiliary presentations. Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct and indirect bilirubin was common, although other hematology and biochemistry examinations were within normal limits on most occasions. There was no mortality in our series. A slightly increasing prevalence of AHA was noted over the two decades of the study period, although it was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results found that children with AHA tended to present with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms and acute liver function deterioration. Elevation of hepatic aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase with cholestasis was common."
4,The role of vaccine in controlling hepatitis A epidemics.,"We report the conduct and results of a review of recent literature to describe various types of epidemics and outbreaks in Italy or countries with similar epidemiological profiles and to assess vaccine use in outbreak situations. We identified three scenarios most likely to occur in Italy: outbreaks occurring in small closed communities (nursery or a primary school), outbreaks in communities of limited dimensions (small towns or villages) and open community settings in which epidemics occur at regular intervals (person-to-person transmission). In closed communities we recommend vaccination of family members and school personnel living or working in close proximity to the index case as well as classmates. We also recommend vaccination when there is a proof of secondary transmission within the community. In small open communities we recommend vaccination of more susceptible age groups such as children and adolescents. For large open communities the only practicable alternative strategy is vaccination of close family contacts of acute cases couple with non-immunity boosting control measures."
5,Autoimmune hepatitis triggered by acute hepatitis A.,"The patient was a 57-year-old woman presenting with jaundice as the chief complaint. She began vomiting on July 10, 2003. Jaundice was noted and admitted to our hospital for thorough testing. Tests on admission indicated severe hepatitis, based on: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 1 076 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1 400 IU/L; total bilirubin (TB), 20.9 mg/dL; and prothrombin time rate (PT%), 46.9%. Acute hepatitis A (HA) was diagnosed based on negative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus RNA and positive immunoglobulin (Ig) M HA antibody, but elevation of anti-nuclear antigen (X320) and IgG (3 112 mg/dL) led to suspicion of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Plasma exchange was performed for 3 d from July 17, and steroid pulse therapy was performed for 3 d starting on July 18, followed by oral steroid therapy. Liver biopsy was performed on August 5, and the results confirmed acute hepatitis and mild chronic inflammation. Levels of AST and ALT normalized, so dose of oral steroid was markedly reduced. Steroid therapy was terminated after 4 mo, as the patient had glaucoma. Starting 3 mo after cessation of steroid therapy, levels of AST and ALT began to increase again. Another liver biopsy was performed and AIH was diagnosed based on serum data and biopsy specimen. Oral steroid therapy was reinitiated. Levels of AST and ALT again normalized. The present case was thus considered to represent AIH triggered by acute HA."
6,The A's and B's of vaccine-preventable hepatitis: improving prevention in high-risk adults.,"Acute hepatitis A and acute hepatitis B are associated with significant morbidity, time away from work or usual activities, substantial cost to the healthcare system, and some mortality. Despite the availability of vaccines against hepatitis B and hepatitis A since 1981 and 1995, respectively, and a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine since 2001, immunization rates against these vaccine-preventable diseases are appallingly low. In particular, several groups of adults, such as men who have sex with men, heterosexuals with multiple partners, injection drug users, persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection, travelers to endemic areas, and persons with chronic liver disease, are at particularly high risk for acute hepatitis A and B or for a more severe illness or a higher rate of chronicity in the case of hepatitis B. Studies have confirmed that hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines are safe and immunogenic in patients in these populations, although patients with more advanced disease may respond less well. These observations have led to the recommendation that patients falling into the above risk groups undergo hepatitis A and B vaccination early in the natural history of their underlying risk behavior or diseases. Vaccination rates are low in clinical practice, and public health and educational programs are needed to overcome barriers to facilitate timely implementation of these recommendations. The use of a combined vaccination, possibly using an accelerated administration schedule, provides convenience and may increase compliance."
7,Is hepatitis A more severe in patients with chronic hepatitis B and other chronic liver diseases?,"There are several published case series of acute hepatitis A, with coverage ranging from epidemics to case reports, that provide information regarding the clinical course and outcome of hepatitis A in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (1-12). Only a few reports have addressed the outcome of hepatitis A in patients with other chronic liver diseases (2, 13). Some, but not all, of these reports suggest that hepatitis A superimposed on chronic hepatitis B or other chronic liver diseases is associated with higher peak laboratory abnormalities, more severe disease, including fulminant hepatic failure, and a higher case fatality rate. In addition, analysis of HBsAg titer and serum markers of HBV replication, including HBeAg, HBV DNA, and DNA polymerase, reveals suppression of HBV replication. With the availability of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine in many countries and its imminent approval for use in the United States, the issue of whether or not patients with chronic liver diseases, including chronic HBV infection, should be a target group for vaccination to prevent hepatitis A warrants consideration. The purpose of this review is to analyze the published literature addressing the clinical course and outcome of acute hepatitis A in patients with chronic HBV infection and other chronic liver diseases to determine if hepatitis A is more severe in these patients."
8,[Post-exposure vaccination against hepatitis A].,"The dramatic decrease in the incidence of hepatitis A in France renders routine vaccination unecessary. However, the main problem concerns prophylaxis for persons exposed to an index case, because nonspecific immunoglobulins are recommended but unavailable in France for this indication. The vaccination of persons who come into contact with an index case is possible in the days following exposure. Some data relating to exposure within the household and in small communities, including nursery schools, have been reported: immunisation in such situations is effective and recommended by the British Advisory Board in the 7 days following exposure, but not in France. The availability of this form of protection and active individual prophylaxis should be suggested to families by clinicians."
9,CDC provides advice on recent hepatitis A outbreaks.,"The epidemiology of hepatitis A virus disease has changed. Since July 2016, there have been 5 large outbreaks of infection involving more than 1600 cases, with affected states requiring assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two of these outbreaks were foodborne, and 3 involved person-to-person transmission. This article reviews the extent of the outbreaks, what's behind the outbreaks, and outbreak-specific vaccine recommendations."
