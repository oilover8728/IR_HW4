0,The multiple aetiology of viral hepatitis.,Infectious hepatitis is epidemiologically and immunologically distinct from serum hepatitis. The Australia antigen is related more specifically to serum hepatitis. The possible role of coronavirus?and paramyxovirus-like particles in the aetiology of some infections of the liver in man and in marmosets inoculated with human infectious hepatitis material is discussed and the difficulties in the interpretation of the currently available data are emphasized. The recent studies in Melbourne of a faecal antigen found in some patients with infectious hepatitis and the discovery of an antiserum in Milan which reacted with an antigen associated with epidemic hepatitis are discussed. Mention is made of the recent isolation in Detroit-6 cells of virus-like particles from patients with infectious hepatitis. It is concluded that viral hepatitis is an infection of multiple aetiology and that the successful cultivation in vitro of the agent or agents of hepatitis remains the outstanding and most urgent problem.
1,Hepatitis A: report of a common-source outbreak with recovery of a possible etiologic agent. I. Epidemiologic studies.,"From the end of October to the end of December 1973, an epidemic of hepatitis A affected 40 students at a state university, 11 employees of two restaurants, and 11 other residents in a southwestern metropolitan community. Two distinct epidemic waves of illness occurred, and investigation implicated two local restaurants as sources of infection, one for each epidemic wave. An index patient who prepared food was identified at each restaurant, and the two restaurants were linked by the fact that the index patient who worked at the second restaurant had patronized the first restaurant. Foods implicated as vehicles of transmission included 'guacamole,' green salad, spaghetti, and hamburger. The findings represent a rare example of a 'double' common-source outbreak with two distinct epidemic waves related to two separate eating establishments."
2,Hepatitis A with pleural effusion: a rare association.,"Hepatitis A is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in children. Its association with pleural effusion has rarely been reported. The present communication describes three cases of hepatitis A associated with pleural effusion. All three had complete clinical, biochemical and radiological recovery. In view of spontaneous resolution, diagnostic or therapeutic pleural tap is not warranted."
3,[Clinical forms of hepatitis A].,"Introduction: Although its incidence has decreased during the last 20 years, hepatitis A is still the most common hepatitis. In most cases, hepatitis A is asymptomatic. When it is symptomatic, the course is benign in most cases. The aim of this review is to summarize current data regarding unusual clinical forms of hepatitis A. Current knowledge and key points: Hepatic insufficiency is the most severe complication of hepatitis A. It is more commonly observed in adult patients. In most cases, the outcome of hepatic insufficiency is rapidly favorable. In rare cases, hepatic insufficiency progresses and encephalopathy subsequently occurs. At this stage, emergency liver transplantation may be necessary. Apart from hepatic insufficiency, the course of hepatitis A may be characterized by a relapse following initial improvement (relapsing hepatitis A) and prolonged cholestasis. Future prospects and projects: In regard to patients with liver insufficiency, physicians should be educated about the need to prevent all iatrogenic factors which could impair the outcome and to maintain a situation propitious to rapid liver regeneration, a necessary condition for recovery. When this prevention fails and liver transplantation has to be considered, auxiliary transplantation should always be considered because this procedure preserves the possibility of a delayed regeneration. The justification of systematic vaccination of patients with chronic hepatitis B, who could be at higher risk for hepatic insufficiency during hepatitis A, is controversial."
4,[The clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis of Yersinia hepatitis and viral hepatitis A and B].,"Hepatic involvement in yersiniosis is associated with clinical symptoms of hepatitis, sometimes dominant in the clinical picture. Such cases need differentiation of yersiniosis with viral hepatitides A and B. Clinical and biochemical findings were compared for matched patients with yersiniosis-induced hepatic lesions, viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis B verified at specific laboratory examination. This permitted introduction of differential diagnostic signs able to recognize one disease from the other."
5,[Viral hepatitis in pregnant women--the relationship of the severity of the disease to the etiology of the infection].,"The author summarizes the experience of many years (1956-1989) gained with studies into the relationship between the gravity of viral hepatitides in the pregnant and etiology of disease. Virus A hepatitis runs a favourable course in the pregnant, i.e. without severe and fulminant forms. In virus B hepatitis, the pregnant women are threatened with the development of hepatic coma associated with a high maternal lethality. The latter one has noticeably been decreasing over the recent years (from 1.79% in 1956-1965 to 0.29% in 1966-1980 and to 0.21% in 1981-1989, which is not so much related to the perfection of the treatment methods as to the diminution of the share of virus B hepatitis. Virus E hepatitis may be of the greatest mortal danger for mothers in conditions of water epidemic. In that case the lethality among pregnant women may reach 12.1% (in the Turkmenian SSR) and 15.6% (in the Kirghiz SSR). The aggravating influences of virus C and D hepatitides on the pregnancy outcomes and maternal lethality have not been studied much. Estimation of etiological factors in viral hepatitis occurring in the pregnant is an important prerequisite for organization of the rational preventive and treatment measures."
6,The cost of hepatitis A infections in American adolescents and adults in 1997.,"The incidence of hepatitis A has declined in the United States for several decades, leading to an increased number of susceptible adolescents and adults. Because clinical severity increases with age, hepatitis A infections in older individuals cause greater morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs. Because the economic burden of hepatitis A has not been well described, we estimated its costs, from the societal perspective, for patients infected at distinct ages. A case-series study described treatment patterns, work loss, and symptom duration. Disease outcomes were estimated by an expert panel. Economic losses were calculated by applying normative data reflecting treatment charges, employee compensation, and the value of housekeeping services. In the case-series study, mean treatment charges were $740 for nonhospitalized patients versus $6,914 for hospitalized patients (P <.001). Symptom duration (67.8 vs. 34.4 days, P <.001) and work loss (33.2 vs. 15.5 days, P <.01) were also greater for those hospitalized. Nationally, we estimate 63,363 symptomatic hepatitis A infections occurred among adolescents and adults during 1997, resulting in 8,403 hospital admissions and 255 deaths. Nearly 2.5 million days of symptomatic illness and 829,000 work-loss days resulted, and 7,466 years of life were lost. Under base-case assumptions, annual hepatitis A costs were estimated at $488.8 million. In sensitivity analyses, this estimate varied from $332.4 to $579.9 million. These costs may be reduced by regionally targeted vaccination of children, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, although the cost effectiveness of this policy has not yet been established."
7,[Hepatitis A in Europe today: epidemiology and prevention].,The susceptibility to Hepatitis A virus infection is growing among the European population and many hepatitis outbreaks have been described in 2004-2008. The change in epidemiological characteristics observed in the last decades has to be taken in account in issuing specific recommendations about the use of the vaccine in pre and post exposure prophylaxis.
8,"Ascertainment of secondary cases of hepatitis A--Kansas, 1996-1997.","Each year, 25,000-30,000 cases of hepatitis A are reported in the United States. The most common infection source (22%-26%) is household or sexual contact with a person already infected with hepatitis A virus (HAV) (i.e., the source-patient). In Kansas during 1992-1997, contact with a source-patient was reported by 39% of persons with hepatitis A. Cases reported in 1996 and 1997 were studied retrospectively to determine the reasons for the apparently high proportion of secondary cases and to evaluate missed opportunities for prevention (i.e., postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin [IG]). Results of this investigation indicate that persons with hepatitis A often were classified incorrectly as secondary cases and that some correctly identified secondary cases represented missed opportunities for prevention."
9,Hepatitis A in a food worker and subsequent prophylaxis of restaurant patrons.,"A laboratory-confirmed case of hepatitis A was reported to Tri-County Health Department (TCHD) in Colorado, and the infected person was subsequently determined to have been a food worker at a local restaurant during the period of infectiousness. After conducting a public health risk assessment, TCHD decided to offer immune globulin (IG) to potentially exposed restaurant patrons. A two-day clinic in Adams County, Colorado, administered IG to 693 individuals. Planning, implementation, and evaluation of this clinic used a total of 900 staff hours and had a financial cost of dollar48,300. No additional restaurant employees became ill, and no secondary cases of hepatitis A were reported within the community. The mass-prophylaxis clinic was an important public health measure taken to prevent the potential spread of illness. The experience also provided relevant hands-on emergency-preparedness training that can be applied in other settings."
