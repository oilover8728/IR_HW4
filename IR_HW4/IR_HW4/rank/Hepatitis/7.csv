0,Idiopathic autoimmune chronic hepatitis triggered by hepatitis A.,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is a well-recognized cause of acute hepatitis with jaundice in adults. However, chronic sequelae of HAV infection are so rare and so poorly defined that their existence remains speculative. In this report we describe a middle-aged woman in whom serologically defined acute hepatitis A appeared to trigger the onset of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. This and two previously reported cases suggest that in certain individuals, presumably with a genetic predisposition to the development of autoimmune hepatitis, HAV infection may be the precipitating event in the pathogenesis of this disorder."
1,Hepatitis A in day care centre.,A focal outbreak of hepatitis was detected in a day-care centre for children centrally located in Pune. The source of infection was suspected to be an 11-year-old child who probably got the infection from his school. Seven out of 15 children from day-care centre developed clinical hepatitis. Two cases of secondary infection were identified among the family contacts of infected children. Sera from all the nine sick children were positive for anti-hepatitis A virus-IgM antibodies. A stool sample from a case of secondary infection showed presence of HAV-RNA by RT-nested PCR. These findings proved that the outbreak was caused by hepatitis A virus.
2,Enterically transmitted hepatitis. Hepatitis A and E viruses.,"Enterically-transmitted hepatitis is caused by hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus. The most important agent is hepatitis A virus, which is distributed worldwide and infects all age groups. Most infections in children are minimally symptomatic and immunity is long-lasting, so severe disease tends to occur in nonimmune adults. Hepatitis E virus is found in the developing world and has a greater propensity for symptomatic infection of children. Both agents are transmitted via contaminated water, often through food vehicles."
3,Patterns of childhood hepatitis in the Nigerian African.,"A total of 133 children aged between less than a month to 14 years presenting consecutively with hepatitis were prospectively studied over a 6-year period. Most cases were acute and presented at the icteric phase. The peak incidence was in very young infants whose illness had to be differentiated from congenital biliary tract obstruction. The older children exhibited the usual manifestations of lethargy, anorexia and tenderness over the liver area to varying degrees. There were 2 cases of chronic active hepatitis in children aged 13 and 14 years, one a female and the other a male. Their illness was controlled with steroid therapy. The serum biochemistry was characteristic in all cases. Serological tests revealed that about 55% of the children had antibody to hepatitis A virus but only 4% demonstrated HAV-specific IgM, while 15% had hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 23% demonstrated antibody to core antigen (HBcAg). While most of the children with acute hepatitis made a full clinical and biochemical recovery, 2 have persistent HBs antigenaemia. There were 3 deaths in children who had fulminant hepatitis. Our results show that exposure to hepatitis A virus appears to be prevalent in Nigerian children and probably occurs quite early in life, and infections with hepatitis B virus and perhaps other hepatotropic viruses are also not uncommon. The surveillance of such children and long-term follow-up are necessary. There is already compelling evidence to indicate that hepatocellular carcinoma, prevalent among young adults in our environment, may be related to hepatitis B antigenaemia persisting over several years. The need for an effective vaccine against hepatitis B virus infection cannot, therefore, be over-emphasized."
4,Recent advances in the hepatitides.,"Five major types of viral hepatitis have been described. The recent detection of the delta, C, and E agents has made possible the description of the clinical spectra of the disease. The recent recommendation on the universal immunization against hepatitis B has been a major step towards prevention of HBV infection. Recent studies have shown that interferon alfa-2a and alfa-2b may be useful in those with chronic hepatitis B and C. Future investigations are needed so that treatment and prevention of the other viral entities, especially in those who are immunocompromised, may be instituted. Liver transplantation offers hope in a subset of patients with end-stage liver disease."
5,"Acute viral hepatitis: a comparative study of clinical, biochemical, morphological and immunological features in patients with and without Australia Antigen.","500 consecutive patients with acute viral hepatitis verified by biopsy were divided into groups of 202 patients with detectable Australia (Au) antigen and 298 patients without antigenaemia at the time of admission to hospital. Comparison was made of the initially recorded clinical, biochemical, histological and serological variables in the two groups. Judged by both histological and biochemical criteria, the acute disease was more severe in the 202 patients with Au antigen than in the 298 patients without Au antigen. Evidence is presented that this difference is possibly due more to qualitative aetiological differences between the two groups than to the duration of antigenaemia or the time of hospitalization. Thus, the demonstration of Au antigenaemia provides not only epidemiological but also relevant clinical information."
6,Hepatitis A. Analysis of a community outbreak.,"The 1987 outbreak of hepatitis A in the Southwest Missouri town of Nevada illustrates a number of public health measures that can quickly and effectively halt an epidemic. Cooperation among state health officials, individual physicians and the news media is just one aspect of the control of such an outbreak."
7,Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of hepatitis A virus infection in marmoset Callithrix jacchus.,"Samples of serum, feces and liver tissue and organs of six cotton-eared marmosets Callithrix jacchus infected intravenously with two different strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV), were studied by conventional histologic techniques, by serological techniques and by immunocytochemical methods, such as immunofluorescence (IF) and peroxidase-antibody techniques. Hepatitis A antigen (HAAg) was detectable in daily collected stools, in liver biopsy obtained sequentially, and in organs collected at necropsy. Two marmosets also developed antibodies to HAV. By contrast, serum transaminases were not altered and there were histological hepatic lesions consistent with acute viral hepatitis in all inoculated animals. The data obtained, demonstrate that these primates are susceptible to human HAV and may be a useful animal model for the study of infection by this virus."
8,Recent advance on viral hepatitis A.,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is an old disease in the world, usually spread by the fecal-oral route. The uncomplicated patients usually recovery within 6 months. Its mortality is age-dependent. A high fatality rate with fulminate course and among chronic hepatitis B or C patients with HAV super-infection was observed. In recent two to three decades, the improvement of public health and hygiene has reduced the incidence of hepatitis A in children and adolescents worldwide; therefore, a massive outbreak of hepatitis A becomes possible among general population who neither have been infected nor have had any protective antibodies. Currently, the commercially available inactivated hepatitis A vaccine is proved to be safe and immunogenic in different risk groups, including children and adults, in several large clinical trials. Considering the potential for epidemic outbreak and the severity of the disease, immunization against the infection among risk population turns important for the prevention and control of HAV infection."
9,Outbreak of acute hepatitis A in the health area served by the Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria (HUVV): a change in epidemiology.,"In 2016, an outbreak of hepatitis A was identified in the Malaga province among patients with specific epidemiological characteristics, which were predominantly males. This is a report of 51 subjects with acute hepatitis A and a mean age of 35.7 years, 90% were male and 55% of cases were men who had had sex with other men within the last two months. Half of them required hospitalization for significant coagulopathy at diagnosis and no cases progressed to fulminant failure or encephalopathy. Four patients had ascites at the time of diagnosis. This outbreak adds to those reported in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with a similar number of cases and epidemiology. These studies highlight the importance of epidemiological surveillance, the need for vaccination in this particular at risk population and the need for informative campaigns in order to prevent this disease."
